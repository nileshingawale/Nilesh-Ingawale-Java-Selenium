Anonymous object 
1.Some thing which dont has reference is called as anonymous object

		eg new Demo() // only object


2.Java designers advice to use anonymous objects when the object is required 
only once in the program.
3.The advantage is to save memory, as anonymous object dies immediately.


		

public class Demo
{
  int x = 10;
  public void display()
  {
    System.out.println("Hello 1");
  }
  public static void main(String args[])
  {
    System.out.println(new Demo().x);
    System.out.println(new Demo().x);
    System.out.println(new Demo().x);
    new Demo().display();
    new Demo().display();
  }
}
